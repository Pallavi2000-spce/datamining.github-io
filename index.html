<h1>Data Mining</h1>
<h2 style="color:purple;">Introduction of Data Mining</h2>
<p><strong>Data mining</strong> is the process of extracting patterns from data ,<br/>Data mining is becoming an increasingly important tool to
 transform this data into information,
<br/>It is commonly used in a wide range of profiling practices,<br/> such as marketing, surveillance, fraud detection and scientific discovery,<br/>
<strong>Data mining</strong> can be used to uncover patterns in data but is often carried out only on samples of data.<br/> The mining process will be ineffective if the samples are not a good, representation of the larger body of data.<br/> Data mining cannot discover patterns that may be present in the larger body of data if those patterns are not present in the sample being "mined".
 <br/>Inability to find patterns may become a cause for some disputes between customers and service providers.<br/> Therefore data mining is not foolproof but may be useful if sufficiently representative data samples are collected.
<br/> The discovery of a particular pattern in a particular set of data does not necessarily mean that a pattern is found <br/>where in the larger data from which that sample was drawn.
<br/> An important part of the process is the verification and validation of patterns on other samples of data. </p>
<h2 style="color:green;"> History of Data mining</h2>
<img src="history.jpg" width="200px" height="150px">
<p>You might think the history of Data Mining started very recently as,<br/> it is commonly considered with new technology.<br/> However data mining is a discipline with a long history<br/>. It starts with the early Data Mining methods Bayes’<br/> Theorem (1700`s)and Regression analysis (1800`s) which were mostly identifying patterns
 in data.</p>
<h2 style="color:purple;">What is mean By Data Mining</h2>
<p>In simple words, data mining is defined as ,<br/>a process used to extract usable data from a larger set of any raw data.<br/> It implies analysing data patterns in large batches of data using one or more software.<br/><strong> Data mining</strong> has applications in multiple fields, like science and research.<br/> As an application of data mining, businesses can learn more,
<br/> about their customers and develop more effective strategies related to various business functions and,<br/> in turn leverage resources in a more optimal and insightful manner.
<br/> This helps businesses be closer to their objective and make better decisions.<br/> Data mining involves effective data collection and warehousing as well as computer processing.
 <br/>For segmenting the data and evaluating the probability of future events,
 <br/>data mining uses sophisticated mathematical algorithms.<br/> Data mining is also known as Knowledge Discovery in Data (KDD).</p>
<h2 style="color:green;">Techniqes of Data Mining</h2>
<h3>1.Regression</h3>
<p>Regression is a data mining technique used to predict a,<br/> range of numeric values (also called continuous values), <br/>given a particular dataset. For example,<br/> regression might be used to predict the cost of a product or service,<br/> given other variables.</p>
<h3>2.Classification</h3>
<p>It is a Data analysis task,<br/> i.e. the process of finding a model that describes and distinguishes data classes and concepts. <br/><strong>Classification</strong> is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (subpopulations),<br/> a new observation belongs to, on the basis of a training set of,<br/> data containing observations and whose categories membership is known.</p>
<h3>3.Clustering</h3>
<p> The process of making a group of abstract objects into<br/> classes of similar objects is   known as clustering.<br/>
In the process of cluster analysis,<br/> the first step is to partition the set of data into groups with the help of,<br/> data similarity, and then groups are assigned to their respective lables.</p>
<h3>4.Association</h3>
<p> In basic terms, association rules present relations between items.
<br/> They are statements that help to discover relationships between data in a database.
<br/> An association rule can be defined as an implication of the form A → B. Here ‘A’ is called premise, 
<br/>which represents a condition that must be true for ‘B’ to hold. ‘B’ is a conclusion that happens ,<br/>when ‘A’ is true. ‘A’ is called antecedent and ‘B’ is called consequent. 
<br/>An antecedent is an element found in ,data<br/> where as a consequent is found in combination with the antecedent. <br/>The rule A → B can be interpreted as: If A happens, B happens,
<br/> This is a very general interpretation; <br/>the accurate interpretation depends on the domain.</p>
<h2 style="color:purple;">Working of Data Mining</h2>
<p> There is an abundance of data across various industries,<br/> but it only becomes useful when it is transformed into information. <br/>The method of extracting information from enormous data is known as data mining. <br/>Data mining find its application across various industries such as market analysis, business management,<br/> fraud inspection, corporate analysis and risk management, among others,<br/>
